THings still to be done:
========================
* Do not manipulate Ender IO powered spawners when changing mob spawner values at chunk load.
* Implement recipes to create mob spawners, and adjust default config to vary based on present mods.
* Implement a solution to allow the mod's functionality to be used in an SMP environment.
* Pollish up text strings for configuration file, log messages, and in-game chat messages.
* Extend validation code to make sure entities specified in config file actually exist.
